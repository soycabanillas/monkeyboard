About delays: In typical text editing scenarios, Monkeeb's processing delay is masked by various system factors including display refresh cycles, making it imperceptible to users.
For gaming scenarios, input delay becomes more critical. Depending on your configuration options, Monkeeb may introduce minimal delay (measured in milliseconds) for programmed keys. The Monkeeb UI provides transparent information about these delays and offers guidance on minimizing them.
However, keys that aren't programmed execute almost immediately with minimal processing overhead. For programmed keys, the small processing delay is typically far less than the time required to physically move your fingers between keys. Additionally, Monkeeb can execute complex macro sequences at hardware speedsâ€”delivering series of key presses and releases much faster than manual input while providing better ergonomics, faster option selection, and improved muscle memory through custom key mappings.
The Monkeeb interface keeps you informed of any latency considerations, allowing you to make informed decisions about which optimizations matter most for your specific gaming needs.
